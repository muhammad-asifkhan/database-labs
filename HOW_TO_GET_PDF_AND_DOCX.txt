HOW TO GET YOUR LAB REPORT AS PDF OR DOCX
==========================================

You have two files:
  • Lab01_Report.md   (Markdown - for editing)
  • Lab01_Report.html (Ready to print – use this for PDF/DOCX)

--- OPTION 1: GET PDF (easiest) ---
1. Open Lab01_Report.html in Chrome or Firefox (double-click the file).
2. Press Ctrl+P (Print).
3. Set "Destination" or "Printer" to "Save as PDF".
4. Click Save. Name it: Lab01_YourFirstNameYourLastName_RollNumber.pdf

--- OPTION 2: GET DOCX (for Word) ---
A. Using LibreOffice (if installed):
   1. Open LibreOffice Writer.
   2. File → Open → select Lab01_Report.html.
   3. File → Save As → choose format "Microsoft Word 2007-365 (.docx)".
   4. Save as Lab01_YourName_RollNumber.docx.

B. Using Google Docs:

   pandoc Lab01_Report.md -o Lab01_Report.docx

--- ADDING YOUR SCREENSHOTS ---
• In the HTML: You can open Lab01_Report.html in a text editor, find each
  "[INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE]" box, and replace that section with an <img>
  tag pointing to your screenshot file, e.g.:
  <img src="screenshot1.png" width="600" alt="Terminal" />
  Then open the HTML in the browser and print to PDF again.

• In the DOCX: After opening the HTML in Word/LibreOffice or after
  converting with pandoc, insert your screenshots via Insert → Image
  at each placeholder.

Submit the final PDF (or DOCX if allowed) to Google Classroom.
